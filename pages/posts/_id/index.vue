                          Originally created by a designer and a developer at Twitter, Bootstrap has become one of the
                          most popular front-end frameworks and open source projects in the world.

                          Bootstrap was created at Twitter in mid-2010 by @mdo and @fat. Prior to being an open-sourced
                          framework, Bootstrap was known as Twitter Blueprint. A few months into development, Twitter
                          held its first Hack Week and the project exploded as developers of all skill levels jumped in
                          without any external guidance. It served as the style guide for internal tools development at
                          the company for over a year before its public release, and continues to do so today.

                          Originally released on Friday, August 19, 2011, we’ve since had over twenty releases,
                          including two major rewrites with v2 and v3. With Bootstrap 2, we added responsive
                          functionality to the entire framework as an optional stylesheet. Building on that with
                          Bootstrap 3, we rewrote the library once more to make it responsive by default with a mobile
                          first approach.

                          With Bootstrap 4, we once again rewrote the project to account for two key architectural
                          changes: a migration to Sass and the move to CSS’s flexbox. Our intention is to help in a
                          small way to move the web development community forward by pushing for newer CSS properties,
                          fewer dependencies, and new technologies across more modern browsers.
